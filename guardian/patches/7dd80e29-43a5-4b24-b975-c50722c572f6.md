# Guardian Patch Proposal (7dd80e29-43a5-4b24-b975-c50722c572f6)

## Root cause hypothesis
GitHub Pages serves the site under the repo subpath `/liminal-thread-book/`.
One or more asset links (CSS/JS/images) are using root-absolute paths (`/style.css`, `/assets/...`)
or assume `/` as base, causing 404s and a “blank page” symptom.

## Suggested patch steps (GitHub Pages base-path fix)
1. Audit all asset references in `index.html` and any nested pages:
   - Find root-absolute paths starting with `/`
   - Find dynamic base/path assumptions in JS bundlers (if any)
2. Convert asset paths to repo-relative:
   - Use `./style.css`, `./assets/...` (or `assets/...`) instead of `/style.css`
3. If you intentionally want a base tag, set it explicitly for repo-pages:
   - Add `<base href="/liminal-thread-book/">` in `<head>`
   - Ensure all links remain correct with base applied
4. Add a `.nojekyll` file if any folders start with `_` or you want to avoid Jekyll processing.
5. Smoke-test on Pages URL:
   - hard refresh
   - check Network tab for 404
   - verify CSS loaded and main content visible

## Signals
- site: https://safal207.github.io/liminal-thread-book/
- symptom: blank / partially rendered page (likely missing assets)

## Verification checklist
- [ ] Open the Pages URL and confirm the main page renders (no blank screen)
- [ ] DevTools → Network: no 404 for CSS/JS/images
- [ ] Reload with cache disabled: page still renders
- [ ] Verify internal links work under `/liminal-thread-book/`
- [ ] Confirm the change is reversible (single-path edits, no data migration)
